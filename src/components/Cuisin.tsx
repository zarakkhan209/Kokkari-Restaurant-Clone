                Although we operate in San Francisco and draw on the bounty of
                Northern California, we owe our culinary aesthetic to Greece,
                where diners take more pleasure in quality ingredients than in
                artful embellishment. <br />
                <br />
                We have modernized many Greek dishes while staying true to the
                signature tastes of the Greek table, respecting the pure flavors
                of sweet baby lamb, tangy homemade yogurt, and the woodsy scent
                of wild oregano. <br /> <br />
                While Greece is a country with dramatically varied landscapes
                and widely dispersed archipelagos, there is a singularly Greek
                flavor palette, a collection of ingredients and preparation,
                that define what we do at the Kokkari. <br /> <br />
                The appetizing aroma of wood smoke, coming from our open hearth,
                charcoal grill, and wood-fired oven, perfumes our dishes and
                enhances the of warmth of family and friends. <br /> <br />
                Our menu, showcasing seafood and game, features many of the most
                sought-after traditional Aegean dishes, as well as selections
                which have been modernized through the innovative blending of
                cultures and techniques. Horiatiki, the classNameic Greek salad
                is offered along side the Maroulosalata, a version of the
                chopped salad with a creamy feta dressing, pine nuts and
                Kalamata olives. Tender grilled octopus is garnished with lemon
                juice and olive oil; a classNameic Greek preparation, while
                calamari is stuffed with feta, fennel and orange; a more modern
                combination. Lamb chops are served straight from the mesquite
                grill with hints of garlic, oregano and lemon juice. While
                traditional soutzoukakia, or lamb meatballs, are enlivened with
                a hint of cumin and tangy Greek yogurt. <br />
