                At Kokkari Estiatorio, we are driven by the concept of
                philoxenia, the art of making a stranger a friend. This
                philosophy drives our efforts to create a cuisine fit for the
                gods with the hospitality of a proper Greek home — a restaurant
                that you would never want to leave. <br />
                <br />
                Named after a small fishing village on the island of Samos in
                the Aegean Sea, Kokkari is the sister restaurant to acclaimed
                Evvia Estiatorio in Palo Alto, California.
                <br />
                <br />
                Legendary Kokkari is the site where Orion, son of the Greek god
                Poseidon, fell in love with the daughter of the King of Chios.
                For her love, Orion foraged the island for wild game and seafood
                to prepare elaborate banquets: Cuisine fit for the gods.
                <br />
                <br />
                On entering Kokkari, guests experience the old-world charm of a
                rustic Mediterranean country inn. An inviting fireplace,
                extensive woodwork, hand-made pottery and freshly picked flowers
                all reflect the warmth and tradition of ages-old hospitality.

                      Estiatorio since 2000. “From your staff to each and every
                      guest that comes into your establishment, it is important
                      to make everyone feel comfortable and welcome. Restaurant
                      employees that are valued and respected take pride in
                      their work and truly enjoy their jobs. This translates
                      directly to the guest experience.”

                    While Paul may be soft-spoken and charming (qualities he
                    attributes to his Southern upbringing), he is extremely
                    driven. His dedicated, hands-on approach to management
                    ensures the high standards of service and hospitality at the

                    Kirby, Kokkari’s refreshing approach to service emphasizes
                    the emotional elements of hospitality: Have a good time and

                    Paul came to the West Coast after years managing waterfront
                    restaurant properties in The Hamptons outside of New York
                    City. His first job in San Francisco was working alongside
                    acclaimed, Bay Area Chef, Reed Hearon as General Manager of
                    Rose Pistola. After three years with Hearon he came to
                    Kokkari Estiatorio bringing with him a genuine appreciation
                    and knowledge of rustic Meditteranean cuisine and wines, an
                    essential prerequisite for working at Kokkari. In 2006 he
                    was named Managing Partner of both Kokkari and Evvia in
